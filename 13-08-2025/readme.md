Project Idea: Interactive To-Do List Application
This project provides opportunities to integrate and understand each of the mentioned hooks:

    Basic Functionality:
        useState: Manage the list of to-do items (an array of objects) and the input field value for new tasks.
        useEffect: Persist to-do items to local storage when the list changes and load them on initial render.
        useRef: Focus the input field automatically when the component mounts or after adding a new task. 
    Advanced Features & Optimization:
        useReducer: Manage more complex state logic for the to-do list, such as filtering tasks (e.g., "completed," "pending") or handling multiple actions (add, delete, toggle completion).
        useContext: Create a ThemeContext to switch between light and dark modes for the application, demonstrating global state management.
        useCallback: Memoize event handlers (e.g., handleAddTask, handleDeleteItem) passed as props to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
        useMemo: Memoize expensive calculations, such as filtering or sorting the to-do list, to improve performance.
        useLayoutEffect: Perform DOM measurements or manipulations that need to happen synchronously before the browser paints, for example, adjusting the height of the to-do list container based on its content.
